Do not ever instanciate a ControllerNode/Site without going through the
class method instanciate().

Planning

========== =================================================================
0.0alpha0  details view correctly displays any kind of field
0.0alpha1  form view, create/edit urls, with url->field pre-population
0.0alpha2  integration of search engine
0.0alpha3  integration of javascript dependencies, offline tab support
0.0alpha4  integration of jmenu for navigation
0.0alpha5  integration of inlines, "just like in admin" (easy migration)
0.0alpha6  allow merging one formset with the content object form
0.0alpha7  add asmselect widget
0.0alpha8  get js ui mutation configurations set up
0.0alpha9  use autocomplete widget for fk
0.0alpha10 allow media overload
0.0alpha11 allow template overload
0.0alpha12 implement ordering on search results
0.0alpha13 subclass ControllerNode to Site (login, register, etc ...)
0.0alpha14 add controller views: save search criterias, mail new results

client side field level constraints support in controllers

server-side field level constraints support
subclass django.db.models.Model to reverse engineer controllers
document interface driven development, aka easy bucks howto
decouple DBAL
