Shortest way to install jsites is a four-liner in urls.py::

import jsites
urlpatterns = patterns('',
    (r'^%s/', include(jsites.ControllerNode.factory('itbm').urls)),
)

Nothing magic, just a couple of methods on the top of the classic
design of django admin and databrowse apps.

Anyway, after running syncdb, check the runserver stdout, it should
tell which url to open to get started.
